When you hit rock bottom,
then you know you can't stop 'em
Keep on boppin' 'cause the beat that be moppin'
on yo' ass… make y'all dance phhatttt

That's how it goes when you mobbin' with the mojo,
Please no crows on the side show, all hoes…
to the side real quick
I'm tryin' ta holla at them pretty bitches for a minute

So fuck a pretty penny, we in it for the winnin'
You know we spinnin', drop P, just sinnin'
Already got a cup a henny, even though we ain't rentin'
Tryin' to get some ink, but they ain't even printin'

Best back that ass up, 'bout to drop real quick,
This the hit, girl talkin' that slit,
So get to thanksgiving stuffing, real mitten
Quit the sittin', y'all hang like in-decision

She's a cool cat, if she's quick to get splittin'
She make that, she make that ass so phat
She make that, she make that, she make that ass so phat, she make that ass so phat

You know I'm robbin' when Batman's mobbin'
Girl steady hoppin' on that big dick throbbin'
Gettin' a little sloppy, but I ain't gonna stop it,
Little quick trick, she all about slobbin'

Well keep head bobbin', yea the beat beat drop,
Big on the bottom, but she's good on top
Get loose, yea bitch best do it,
Now put your fuckin' hands up, and lemme move to ya

Put your fuckin' hands up, and lemme move to ya
Now put your fuckin' hands up, and lemme move to ya

She make that, she make that ass so phat
